# A Sampling of Ways to Sample Samples

---

# Warmup

We want to take 1 element from a stream of $N$ elements, where $N$ is
unknown. Suppose we can only look at each element once and want each element to
be equally likely to be chosen.

How can we do this?

# Warmup

How can we do this?


```python
def select1(samples):
    selection, count = None, 1
    for sample in samples:
        if random() &lt= 1 / count: # random number in [0,1]
            selection = sample
        count += 1
	return selection 
```

def select1(samples):
    selection, count = None, 1
    for sample in samples:
        if random() &lt= 1 / count: # random number in [0,1]
            selection = sample
        count += 1
	return selection 
```

            selection = sample
        count += 1
	return selection 
```

Why does this work?

We select the $i$th element with probability $1/i$. The probability of <i>not</i>
selecting every following element is

$$ (1-\frac{1}{i+1}) (1-\frac{1}{i+2}) \cdots (1 - \frac{1}{N}) = 
\frac{i}{i+1} \cdot \frac{i+1}{i+2} \cdots \frac{N-1}{N} = \frac{i}{N}$$

Multiplying these two probabilities gives $$\frac{1}{i} \cdot \frac{i}{N} =
\frac{1}{N}$$

# In an ideal world...
## Simple Random Sampling

The goal is to choose a subset of a sample space so that the following
characteristics are met:
1. Elements are chosen at random
2. Each subset is equally likely

The following ways both generate simple random samples of size $k$ from a
population of $N$ elements.
1. Randomly permute the $N$ elements and take the first $k$.
2. Randomly generate an integer $i$ between 1 and $N$. Select the $i$th element,
ignoring those that are already selected. Repeat this selection process until
$k$ elements have been chosen.
---

# Bootstrapping

The idea behind bootstrapping is that we can <i>resample</i> a sample.
Implicitly, we'll assume that our original sample is "close" to the actual
distribution.

# Bootstrapping

The idea behind bootstrapping is that we can <i>resample</i> a sample.
Implicitly, we'll assume that our original sample is "close" to the actual
distribution.

You should be excited by this! Bootstrapping lets us generate synthetic data
sets.

Assume you're Elon Musk and want to know more about SpaceX's rocket launches.
In particular, suppose you want to learn more about an estimator $X$. Rockets
are expensive, so you bootstrap:
1. Resample to get a new sample. Compute $X$ for this sample.
2. Repeat step 1 multiple times.
3. Analyse all the $X$s (e.g. linear regression) 

This is known as <u>non-parametric bootstrapping</u>.
---

# Parametric Bootstrapping

The same idea as before, but we change how we resample.

Instead of resampling directly our original sample, we create a convariance matrix
matching the one for the original sample. Next, we generate a sample for a
parametric distribution using the covariance matrix.

What could go wrong? (don't overlook the obvious)

# Coresets
#### <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/dannyf/subspace.pdf">More formal example</a>

Consider the $j$-clustering problem. Suppose we have:
1. a $n \times d$ matrix $A$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$
2. a cost function $\mathsf{cost} : \mathbb{R}^j \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

Call a $m \times n$ matrix $M$ a $(k,\varepsilon)$-coreset if 

$ \exists c\in \mathbb{R} \quad \forall L= \\{L_1, \ldots, L_k \\}$
$$(1-\varepsilon)\mathsf{cost}(A,L) \leq
\mathsf{cost}(M,L)+c \leq (1+\varepsilon)\mathsf{cost}(A,L)$$

So, a coreset aims to be a good enough approximation of some data with respect
to a cost function. How is this different from clustering?

Coresets try to find subsets that best summarize a set of data with respect to
certain attributes. Clustering uses a metric.

We could achieve a result similar to coresets by using clustering with an
extremely specific metric, but choosing this metric is difficult.

# Sublinear Algorithms

Alon, Matias, and Szegedy founded the field of streaming algorithms in a 1996
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=237814.237823">paper</a>, winning them the 2005 Gödel
Prize.

As their name implies, streaming algorithms target problems where data arrives
via a stream (e.g. a twitter feed) or cannot be accessed all at once. 

Some examples include:
* Frequency moments; suppose we have a set $S$ of numbers and define 
$ F_k = \Sigma s^k$ for all $s \in S$. $F_0$, $F_1$, $F_2$ can be approximated
using logarithmic space.
* Finding the majority in a data set
* Finding the $k$ most frequent items in a set
* Count-min sketch
* Reservoir sampling
---

# Computing the majority

Suppose we have a stream $S$ of numbers, and we want to find which number is the
majority. How should we do this?
---

# Computing the majority

Suppose we have a stream $S$ of numbers, and we want to find which number is the
majority. How should we do this?

```python
def majority(S):
	bestSoFar = (0, None)
	for s in S:
		if bestSoFar[0] == 0: 	# we have nothing, take s
			bestSoFar[0] = 1
			bestSoFar[1] = s
		elif bestSoFar[1] == s:
			bestSoFar[0] += 1
		else: 					# removing both elements preserves the majority
			bestSoFar[0] -= 1
	if bestSoFar[0] == 0: bestSoFar[1] = None
	return bestSoFar[1]
```
---

# Computing frequency
Now, we want to find the $k$ most frequent instead of just the majority. How?
---

# Computing frequency
Now, we want to find the $k$ most frequent instead of just the majority. How?

The idea is the same one we used when finding the majority. This time, we just 
keep a list of $k$ pairs.
---

# Count-min sketch

Count-min is a technique discovered by Cormode and Muthukrishnan and 
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9314/07s1/lectures/Lin_CS9314_References/cm-latin.pdf">published
in 2004</a>. In essence, they applied Bloom filters to data streams. (Hint:
count-min uses spectral bloom filters in a funny hat.)

A count-min sketch works as follows:
1. Choose $d$ independent hash functions $h_1, \ldots, h_d$.
2. Fix a constant $w$. We'll use this as the length of our bit vectors. This
gives us a $w \times d$ array.
3. Every time we have a sample $s$, we compute $h_i(s)$ and increment $(i, h_i(s))$.

We can then query the filters for various properties like counts, inner
products, and quantiles. If we take $w=\frac{e}{\varepsilon}$ and $d=\ln \frac{1}{\delta}$, then 
an estimate $\hat a$ from the filter is $P[\hat a \leq a + \varepsilon|a|] \leq 1 - \delta$.

# Reservoir Sampling

The solution for the warmup generalizes to when we want to select $k$ elements
and don't know the number of samples.

# Reservoir Sampling

The solution for the warmup generalizes to when we want to select $k$ elements
and don't know the number of samples.

```python
def selectk(samples, k):
    n = len(samples)
    reservoir = [ samples[i] for i in range(k) ] # assume k &lt= n
    i = k
    while i &lt n:
        j = random(0, i) # 0 &lt= j &lt i
        if j &lt k:
            reservoir[j] = samples[j]
        i += 1
    return reservoir
```

This is known as reservoir sampling. [Vitter's
paper](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/vitter.pdf) explains it in more detail.
